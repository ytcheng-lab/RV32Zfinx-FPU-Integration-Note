# Lightweight FPU Integration via RV32Zfinx

## ðŸ“Œ Summary
> **This project integrates the Zurich CVFPU into an RV32IM-based SoC to enable the RV32Zfinx extension, improving softmax performance by ~69% execution cycles in RTL simulation (ncverilog)**

## Motivation
While implementing MobileBERT on a resource-limited IoT platform, softmax became a significant performance bottleneck due to its dependence on `exp(x)`, which is costly without floating-point support.  
This project explores the integration of CVFPU to enable RV32Zfinx, allowing the core to execute floating-point operations using integer registers.  
The goal is to validate whether lightweight FPU support can significantly improve AI inference workloads such as softmax on RV32IM-class systems.

## Results
**Spike simulation**
- Input: 512 `float32` values in range `[0, 10)`
- Target: Spike simulator using RV32IMZf toolchain
- Measurement: Cycle count via `mcycle` CSR

| Configuration           | glibc expf() | Optimized (Taylor3 + LUT) | Speedup    | Max Abs Error |
|-------------------------|--------------|----------------------------|------------|----------------|
| RV32IM (no FPU)         | 1,265,689    | 533,376                    | 57.86%     | 0.0003         |
| RV32IMZf (with FPU)     | 66,291       | 51,246                     | 22.70%     | 0.0003         |

**RTL simulation:** 
- Input: 512 `float32` values in range `[0, 10)`
- Target: ncverilog with RTL design
- Measurement: Cycle count via `mtime` CSR
- Compare the execution speed of `expf()` with FPU and without FPU

| Configuration           | glibc expf() | Speedup        |
|-------------------------|--------------|----------------|
| RV32IM (no FPU)         | 6,658,844    | -              |
| RV32IMZf (with FPU)     |  2,077,046   | 68.81%         |

## Observation
- The RV32Zf extension reduces the softmax execution time by approximately 69% when using glibcâ€™s expf() in cycle-accurate RTL simulation.
- Theoretically, software-level optimization (Taylor-series of order 3 + LUT-based approximation) has the potential to provide an additional ~23% improvement. However, the performance observed in the Spike-based testing environment, which measures instruction-level efficiency, does not directly correlate with the cycle-accurate RTL simulation results.
- Limitation: Spike does not model real hardware stalls, memory latency, or cache effects; its results represent functional-cycle estimates only.
